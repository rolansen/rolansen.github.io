**In another post, 
I discuss a few approaches for radiometrically correcting aerial imagery and evaluate their accuracy using real imagery. 
I figured it'd be nice to work with simulated landscapes to see how characteristics of the imagery, 
like the presence of objects like trees and houses, affect these methods' performances.  
Here I talk about how we'd begin to approach doing that sort of thing
using Gaussian random fields and random sets.
Simulations are ran with R and the libraries NLMR, spatstat, raster, and sf.**

The first thing I'd like to look at are the effects of spatial (auto)covariance. 
One way to do this is to repeatedly simulate a Gaussian random field (GRF) and adjust the mean and covariance function's parameters (sill, range, nugget). 

I'll talk about GRF's briefly. Say we have some process *Y*(**s**), where the *d*-dimensional location vector **s** is in some study area **D** ⊂ ℝ*ᵈ* (usually *d* = 2, for the geography-minded). It's often advantageous to assume *Y*(**s**) has a Gaussian distribution, because this implies it can be completely described by its mean and covariance. If this is the case and *Y*(**s**) is defined for all **s** &isin; **D**, then *Y*(**s**) is a GRF. Furthermore, if for two arbitrary locations **sᵢ** and **sⱼ** we have cov(*Y*(**sᵢ**), *Y*(**sⱼ**)) = cov(*h*), where *h* = \||**sᵢ** - **sⱼ**\||, then *Y*(**s**) is stationary (properties don't depend on location) and isotropic (direction doesn't matter). See Cressie (1993) for much more on GRF's.
