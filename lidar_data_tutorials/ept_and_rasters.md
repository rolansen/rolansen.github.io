**This is the second post in a series on using the geospatial Python ecosystem to analyze spatial relationships between lidar point clouds and other GIS datasets. This will be the first of maybe two or three on raster data. This post in particular will discuss how to query [Entwine Point Tile datasets](https://entwine.io/en/latest/entwine-point-tile.html) and efficiently create raster data from the results. **

Today most GIS software makes creating digital elevation/surface models (DEM's/DSM's) from lidar point clouds relatively easy.
